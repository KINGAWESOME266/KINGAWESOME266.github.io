=====================
This is my Github site which I created from demo data created by [Hank Quinlan](http://hankquinlan.github.io) and used in a [step-by-step beginners guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages) to creating and hosting a personal website using GitHub and Jekyll. You can view the demo data at <http://hankquinlan.github.io> and read the guide at <http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages>. 

Users are free to copy and re-use any and all of the code contained here without contacting me.
